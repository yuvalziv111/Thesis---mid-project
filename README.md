# Thesis---mid-project
Creating a simulation of targets detection in the field. We have 3 actual targets and noise which was added to the simulation. out agent (highlighted in green) moves according to the max information gain rule, which means where should I move to get the max information?
In the graphs we can see the convergence of the information gain, which means that we discovered the targets with high confidence within 20 seconds. (In simulation we have 100 seconds). 

Each graph represents another formula for representing the information gain
